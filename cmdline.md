As you work through MySQL Cookbook 4th Edition, you run many examples using the mysql client program, and there are lots of programs in the recipes distribution for you to try as you read. And of course one purpose of the book is to enable you to write your own MySQL-based programs. Consequently, you must often execute programs at the command line that is, at the prompt of your shell or command interpreter. Forbest use of this book, you should also be able to run mysql easily (by entering just its name), and you should be able to execute programs from the recipes distribution or that you write yourself. To accomplish those goals, it’s important that your PATH environment variable be set correctly, and that you know how to make programs executable. The discussion here shows how to do those things.

## Setting Environment Variables

An environment variable has a value that can be accessed by programs as they run. By setting environment variables, you modify your operating environment. One such variable is PATH, which is used by your command interpreter to determine which directories to search when it looks for programs such as mysql that you tell it to execute. If your PATH is set correctly, you can invoke programs easily no matter what your current directory is. If PATH is not set correctly, your command interpreter will not find them. For example, if the PATH value does not include the directory where mysql is installed, a ‘‘command not found’’ error may occur if you attempt to run mysql by entering its name. You must then run it either by specifying its full pathname, or by changing location into the directory where it is installed. Both strategies are inconvenient, and more so with repetition. It’s much better to set your PATH value to name the directories containing the programs you want to use.

Other environment variables are important in other contexts. For example, to run Perl or Ruby scripts that use module files that you’ve installed, you may need to set the PERL5LIB or RUBYLIB variable to tell Perl or Ruby where to find those modules. For Java, the JAVA_HOME variable should be set to indicate the location of your Java installation, and CLASSPATH should be set to the list of libraries and class files that your Java programs need.

The following discussion describes how to set environment variables. The examples demonstrate how to make it easier to run MySQL programs by modifying your PATH setting to add the directory where MySQL programs are installed. However, the discussion applies to other environment variables as well because the variable-setting syntax is the same.

Here are some general principles to keep in mind regarding environment variables:

Executing Programs from the Command Line

 - It’s possible to set an environment variable from the command line, but the variable will retain its value only until you exit the command interpreter. To cause the setting to take effect permanently, set it in the appropriate shell startup file on Unix or by using the Environment Variables interface on Windows (this can be found on the System Control Panel under Advanced). The change takes effect for subsequent invocations of your command interpreter (for example, your next login on Unix, or the next console window that you open on Windows).
 - Some variables (PATH among them) have a value that lists the pathnames for one or more directories. Under Unix, it’s conventional to separate the pathnames using the colon character (:). Under Windows, pathnames can contain colons, so the separator is the semicolon character (;).
 - To check your current environment variable settings, execute an env or printenv command on Unix, or a set command in a console window on Windows


 ## Setting the PATH Variable on Unix

Your choice of command interpreter determines the syntax for setting environment variables. In addition, for settings that you put in a startup file, the file to use is interpreter-specific. The following table shows typical startup files for commonly used Unix command interpreters. If you’ve never looked through your command interpreter’s startup files, it’s a good idea to do so to familiarize yourself with their contents.
| ***Command interpreter***      |  ***Possible startup files*** |
|---|---|
| *sh, bash, ksh* |  .profile, .bash_profile, .bash_login, .bashrc |
| csh, tcsh       | .login, .cshrc, .tcshrc

The examples assume that MySQL programs are installed in the /usr/local/mysql/bin directory; adjust the
instructions for the pathname actually used on your system. The examples also assume that you want to
add that bin directory pathname to an existing PATH value. If you have no PATH setting currently, add the
appropriate line or lines to one of the startup files.

- For a shell in the Bourne shell family (sh, bash, ksh), look in your startup files for a line that sets and
exports the PATH variable:

*export PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin*

 - In that case, change the setting to add the appropriate directory:

*export PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin*

- Change the setting to this:

*PATH=/usr/local/mysql/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin* 
export PATH

- For a shell in the C shell family (csh, tcsh), look in your startup files for a setenv PATH command:

*setenv PATH /bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin*

- Change the setting to add the appropriate directory:

*setenv PATH /usr/local/mysql/bin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin*

It’s also possible that your path will be set with a set path command, which uses different syntax:
*set path = (/usr/local/mysql/bin /bin /usr/bin /usr/local/bin)*

path is not an environment variable, but for C shells, setting path also sets PATH and vice versa.

## Setting the PATH Variable on Windows
To set environment variables on Windows, right-click My Computer on the desktop, then select -> Properties
-> Advanced -> Environment Variables. You should see a window that enables you to define environment
variables or change the values of existing variables. For example, your PATH variable might have a
value like this:

*C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND* 

To make it easier to run MySQL programs such as mysql, change the value to include the directory where
those programs are installed. Adding a directory of C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin
results in a PATH setting that should look like this:

*C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 8.0\bin;C:\WINDOWS;C:\WINDOWS\COMMAND*

## Executing Programs

This section describes how to execute programs from the command line. You can use this information to
run programs that you obtain from the ***recipes*** distribution or that you write yourself. The first set of
instructions applies to scripts written in Perl, Ruby, PHP, or Python. A second set of instructions applies to
Java programs.

The example programs can be found in the progdemo directory of the ***recipes*** distribution.

### Executing Perl, Ruby, PHP, or Python Scripts

The following discussion shows how to execute scripts, using Perl for the examples. The principles are
similar for Ruby, PHP, or Python scripts.

Begin with an example script named *perldemo.pl* that consists of a simple print statement:

*print "I am a Perl program.\n";*

A script-execution method that works on any platform is to invoke the perl program and tell it the name of
the script to run:

***$ perl perldemo.pl***

I am a Perl program.

For a script written in another language, invoke the *ruby, php, or python* program.

It’s also possible to make a script directly executable. The procedure differs for Unix and Windows. Both
procedures are described here.

On Linux, to make a script directly executable, include a line at the top of the file that begins with #! and
that specifies the pathname of the program that should execute the script. Here is a script named
*perldemo2.pl* with a #! line that names the perl program (if *perl* is not located at */usr/bin/perl* on your system,
change the pathname):

#!/usr/bin/perl
print "I am a Perl program.\n";

Next, enable the executable access mode with chmod +x:

***$ chmod +x perldemo2.pl***

At this point, the script can be run the same way as its earlier counterpart (that is, you can use *perl
perldemo2.pl*), but now you should also be able to execute it by entering just its name. However, assuming
that the script is located in your current directory, your shell might not find it. The shell searches for
programs in the directories named in your PATH environment variable, but for security reasons, the search
path for Unix shells often is deliberately set not to include the current directory (.). In that case, include a
leading path of ./ to explicitly indicate the script’s location:

***$ ./perldemo2.pl***
I am a Perl program.

If you install the script by copying it to a directory that is named in your PATH setting, the leading ./ path
is unnecessary when you invoke the script.

On Windows, the procedure for making scripts executable is somewhat different. *chmod* is not used.
Instead, programs are treated as executable based on their filename extensions (such as .exe or .bat). Windows
enables you to set up filename mappings that associate a programs with filenames that end with a particular
suffix. This means that you can set up associations so that Perl, Ruby, PHP, or Python are used to
execute files with names that end in .pl, .rb, .php, or .py, respectively. (The installer for a given language
might even create the association for you.) Then you can invoke a script with a given extension directly
from the command line without naming its language interpreter:

***C:\> perldemo.pl***

I am a Perl program.

No leading path is needed to invoke a script that is located in the current directory because the Windows
command interpreter includes that directory in its search path by default.

Keep the preceding principles in mind when you run scripts from within a directory of the recipes distribution.
For example, if your current location is the metadata directory of the distribution and you want to
execute the *get_server_version.rb* Ruby script, you can do so with either of these commands on Unix:

***$ ruby get_server_version.rb***
***$ ./get_server_version.rb***

On Windows, you can use either of these commands:

C:\> ***ruby get_server_version.rb***
C:\> ***get_server_version.rb***

## Compiling and Executing Java Programs

Java programming requires a Java Development Kit (JDK). If a JDK is not already installed on your system,
obtain one and install it. OS X comes with a JDK. For Solaris, Linux, and Windows, JDKs are available
at http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/index.html.

After verifying that a JDK is installed, set the JAVA_HOME environment variable if it’s not already set. Its
value should be the pathname of the directory where the JDK is installed. If the JDK installation directory
is /usr/local/java/jdk on Unix or C:\jdk on Windows, set JAVA_HOME as follows:

- For a shell in the Bourne shell family (sh, bash, ksh):

*export JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk*

- For the original Bourne shell, sh, you may need to split this into two commands:

*JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk
export JAVA_HOME*

- For a shell in the C shell family (csh, tcsh):

*setenv JAVA_HOME=/usr/local/java/jdk*

- For Windows, get to the Environment Variables window as described previously in ‘‘Setting Environment
Variables,’’ then set JAVA_HOME to this value:

*C:\jdk*

Adjust the instructions for the pathname actually used on your system.

With a JDK in place and JAVA_HOME set, you should be able to compile and run Java programs. Here is a
sample program:

```java
public class JavaDemo
{
  public static void main (String[] args)
  {
  System.out.println ("I am a Java program."); 
  }
}
```
The ***class*** statement indicates the program’s name, which in this case is JavaDemo. The name of the
file containing the program should match this name and include a .java extension, so the filename for the
program is JavaDemo.java. Compile the program using *javac*:

*$ javac JavaDemo.java*

The Java compiler generates compiled byte code to produce a class file named *JavaDemo.class*. Use the
*java* program to run the class file (specified without the *.class* extension):

*$ java JavaDemo*
I am a Java program.

To compile and run Java programs that use MySQL, you need the MySQL Connector/J JDBC driver. If
Java cannot find the driver, you must set your CLASSPATH environment variable. Its value should include
at least your current directory (.) and the pathname of the Connector/J driver. If the driver has a pathname
of */usr/local/lib/java/lib/mysql-connector-java-bin.jar* (Unix) or *C:\Java\lib\mysql-connector-java-bin.jar*
(Windows), set ***CLASSPATH*** as follows:

- For a shell in the Bourne shell family (*sh, bash, ksh*):

*export CLASSPATH=.:/usr/local/lib/java/lib/mysql-connector-java-bin.jar*

- For a shell in the C shell family (*csh, tcsh*):

*setenv CLASSPATH .:/usr/local/lib/java/lib/mysql-connector-java-bin.jar*

For Windows, get to the Environment Variables window as described earlier in ‘‘Setting Environment
Variables,’’ then set CLASSPATH to this value:

*.;C:\Java\lib\mysql-connector-java-bin.jar*

Adjust the instructions for the pathname actually used on your system. You might also need to add other
class directories or libraries to your ***CLASSPATH*** setting. The specifics depend on how your system is set
up.

## Compiling and Executing Go Lang Programs

To compile and run Go programs that use MySQL you will need *GO SQL Driver*. This book uses 
[Go-MySQL-Driver](https://github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql). To obtain it if it’s not already installed, install Git, then issue the following command.
```go 
$ go get -u github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql
```

### Setting the GOPATH and GOROOT

***GOPATH*** is an environment variable that tells the GO binary where to look for the code.
In order to set *GOPATH* use the similar methods mentioned above on *Linux* based operating systems. 

While there are different bash files that can be present on one’s system, on Ubuntu or other Linux based operating systems, it is generally recommended to make use of the *bash_rc* which you can open with typing the following command in your terminal.

```bash
vi ~/.bashrc
```

You can also set the ***GOPATH** directly on your system:

```bash
export GOPATH=/root/go_projects
```

Inside the GOPATH we need to have following subfolders:

- ***pkg*** - The directory that will contain the packages and shared object files.
- ***src*** - The directory where all the go code exits.
- ***bin*** - The directory that will contain all the binary executables compiled. 

Setting the ***GOROOT*** inside ***bashrc*** or ***bash_profile*** file is also important similar to ***GOPATH***. 

```bash
export GOROOT=/usr/local/go
```

You can source *bashrc* file. 

```bash
source ~/.bashrc
```

Verify that you have correctly set ***GOPATH*** 

Running examples in *recipes* distribution [recipes](https://github.com/svetasmirnova/mysqlcookbook/tree/master/recipes/api/01_connect)
may require some *GO* environment variables settings. 

If you receive the following error:
```go
$ go run connect.go
connect.go:9:5: no required module provides package github.com/go-sql-driver/mysql: go.mod file not found in current directory or any parent directory; see 'go help modules'
```
Run following to fix the issue by setting *GO111MODULE* setting to ***auto***.  
```bash
$ go env -w GO111MODULE=auto
```
Verify scripts are working:

```bash
$ go run connect.go
Connected!
```
