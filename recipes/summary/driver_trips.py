# driver_trips.py: summarize miles per driver and show a list for each
# driver of the trips they took.

# Two approaches are demonstrated:
# - Two queries.  First query retrieves the summary values, second the
#   list entries.  Print the list entries, preceding the list for each
#   driver with the corresponding summary information.
# - Single query to retrieve the list entries.  Iterate through the list
#   once to compute the summary values, and a second time to print the
#   summary and list information.
