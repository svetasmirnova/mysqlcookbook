# rainfall table: each record indicates date of measurement and amount
# of precipitation on that day.

# This file sets up the table and runs a self join to calculate
# running totals and averages for amount of precipitation each
# day, assuming no missing days.  rainfall2.sql shows the calculations
# if missing days are permitted.
