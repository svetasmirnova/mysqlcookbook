# rand_test.pl: create a frequency distribution of RAND() values.
# This provides a test of the randomness of RAND().

# Method: Draw random numbers in the range from 0 to 1.0,
# and count how many of them occur in .1-sized intervals

import cookbook

npicks = 1000     # number of times to pick a number
bucket = [0] * 10 # buckets for counting picks in each interval

conn = cookbook.connect()
cursor = conn.cursor()

for i in range(0, npicks):
  cursor.execute("SELECT RAND()")
  (val,) = cursor.fetchone()
  slot = int(val * 10)
  if slot > 9:
    slot = 9    # put 1.0 in last slot
  bucket[slot] += 1

cursor.close()
conn.close()

# Print the resulting frequency distribution

for slot, val in enumerate(bucket):
  print("%2d  %d" % (slot+1, val))
