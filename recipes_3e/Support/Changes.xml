Initial release of recipes distribution for MySQL Cookbook, Third Edition.

<item>
I changed the Ruby scripts to remove the -w option from the initial
#!/usr/bin/ruby line. This option can be useful for finding possible
problems (as mentioned in Recipe 2.1), but causes more warnings
with Ruby 1.9 and up than with Ruby 1.8, some of which may originate
from with libraries that are not easily changed. Removing -w silences
these warnings.

<item>
metadata/get_rs_meta.py: In Recipe 10.2, this Python script
shows how to determine whether a statement produces a result set.
It originally checked whether there are any columns using this test:
if cursor.description is None.  Although that works, Connector/Python
cursor objects have a with_rows property designed for that purpose,
so the script now uses that property instead. Also, to avoid an
exception, the code that enumerates cursor.description no longer
executes if there are no columns.
