# store_image.pl: read an image file, store in the image table and
# in the filesystem.  (Normally, you'd store images only in one
# place or another; this script demonstrates how to do both.)
#@ _INITIAL_COMMENT_

# *** BEFORE USING: make sure to set $image_dir appropriately ***

# Note that this script makes no assumptions about the form of the image
# file, so in fact it really works on arbitrary files, no matter what
# they contain.  But it's up to you to specify the correct mime-type
# argument.

# Uses file basename for name column value if no name was given.
